            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Steinway & Sons, also known as Steinway, is an American piano company founded in 1853 in Manhattan by German piano builder Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later known as Henry E. Steinway). The company's growth led to the opening of a factory in New York City, United States, and later, a factory in Hamburg, Germany. Steinway pianos have set an uncompromising standard for sound, touch, beauty, and investment value.</p>
